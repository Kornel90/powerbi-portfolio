# Changeover Analysis Report

## 📌 Context
This report presents data on changeovers occurring on a production line. The data used in the report is fictional and intended for analytical purposes. The main objective is to compare the actual changeover durations with target values to identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement.

---

## ⚙️ Approach
The report is designed to analyze changeover times on the production line and compare them with predefined target durations. By evaluating historical data over time, it helps to identify product groups that fail to meet target expectations.

### 🎯 This analysis enables:
✔️ **Detection of inefficiencies** – pinpointing changeovers that exceed the target time.

✔️ **Waste reduction assessment** – estimating the time lost due to prolonged changeovers.

✔️ **Process improvement** – identifying specific product groups that require optimization.

### 🔹 Key Report Sections:

#### 1️⃣ Filter Section (Top of the Report)
The report allows filtering data based on:

- **Production Shift (A, B, C)** – View changeovers for specific shifts.
- **Product** – Select specific products that were changed over.
- **Date Range** – Adjust the analyzed period using a calendar filter.

#### 2️⃣ Key Metrics
- **Number of Changeovers Displayed** – Total changeovers included in the analysis.
- **Target Gap in minutes** – The difference between actual and target changeover times, showing a significant deviation from the expected values.

#### 3️⃣ Visualizations and Analysis

📊 **Average Changeover Time & Count (Weekly)**
- Displays the number of changeovers across different time ranges (e.g., 0.8 min, 3 min, 4 min).
- Highlights weeks with the highest deviations from the target.

📊 **Histogram of Changeover Times**
- Shows the distribution of changeover times.
- Most changeovers are under 10 minutes, but longer changeovers also occur.

📊 **Total Changeover Time: Actual vs. Target (Bar Chart)**
- Compares actual changeover times vs. target times for individual days.
- Many days show significant target exceedances.

## 📄 Detailed Page

This page provides a detailed table of changeovers for in-depth analysis.

### 🔹 Key Elements:

#### 🎛 Filters & Thresholds (Top Section)
- 🔹 Similar to the main page, users can filter data based on batch size and duration thresholds.
- 🔹 Targets can be adjusted (e.g., 0.8 min, 3 min, 4 min, 9 min, 12 min).

#### 📋 Detailed Changeover Table

🔹 Lists individual changeover events, including:

- **Category** (Product Changeover From → To)
- **Start & End Time**
- **Duration (Minutes)**
- **Description** (Target Category: 3 min, 9 min, etc.)
- **Batch Size**
