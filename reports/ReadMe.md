## 📁 Power BI Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Power BI reports developed as individual analytics projects. Each report is organized in a separate folder within the `reports/` directory, including its `.pbix` file, source data, screenshots, and a dedicated `README.md` file describing the report context, structure, and analytical goals.

All datasets are fictional and intended solely for skill demonstration purposes.

## 🛠️ Technologies

The reports were developed using the following tools and technologies:

- **Power BI Desktop** – for data modeling and report design
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – to build calculated measures and KPIs
- **Power Query (M)** – for data transformation and ETL processes
- **T-SQL** – most `.csv` source files were exported from SQL Server databases using T-SQL queries

## 📌 Purpose

This portfolio presents sample analytics projects created to reflect real-life scenarios. Each report simulates an end-to-end workflow, showcasing Power BI capabilities including data modeling, KPIs, visualizations, and user interaction design.

While the data is synthetic, the reports are built to illustrate realistic use cases. They are designed to support recruitment discussions and demonstrate hands-on reporting expertise.
