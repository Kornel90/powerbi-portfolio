## 📁 Power BI Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Power BI reports developed as individual analytics projects. Each report is organized in a separate folder within the `reports/` directory, including its `.pbix` file, source data, screenshots, and a dedicated `README.md` file describing the report context, structure, and analytical goals.

All datasets are fictional and intended solely for skill demonstration purposes.

## 🛠️ Technologies

The reports were developed using the following tools and technologies:

- **Power BI Desktop** – for data modeling and report design
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – to build calculated measures and KPIs
- **Power Query (M)** – for data transformation and ETL processes
- **T-SQL** – most `.csv` source files were exported from SQL Server databases using T-SQL queries

## 📌 Purpose
This portfolio was created to showcase my Power BI skills based on sample data. Each report is built around realistic scenarios to demonstrate how I approach data modeling, creating measures, building visuals, and designing interactive reports.
