Changeover Analysis Report
This report analyzes changeovers on the production line, comparing actual changeover times against target values.
Data are ficional, blanks in reports are caused by lack of data.

🔹 Key Report Sections:
-1️⃣ Filter Section (Top of the Report)
The report allows filtering data based on:

Production Shift (A, B, C) – View changeovers for specific shifts.
Product – Select specific products that were changed over.
Date Range – Adjust the analyzed period using a calendar filter.

-2️⃣ Key Metrics
Number of Changeovers Displayed: 4,078 – Total changeovers included in the analysis.
Target Gap: -18.3K minutes – The difference between actual and target changeover times, showing a significant deviation from the expected values.
3️⃣ Visualizations and Analysis
📊 Average Changeover Time & Count (Weekly - CW27–CW40)
Displays the number of changeovers across different time ranges (e.g., 0.8 min, 3 min, 4 min).
Highlights weeks with the highest deviations from the target.
📊 Histogram of Changeover Times
Shows the distribution of changeover times.
Most changeovers are under 10 minutes, but longer changeovers also occur.
📊 Total Changeover Time: Actual vs. Target (Bar Chart)
Compares actual changeover times vs. target times for individual days.
Many days show significant target exceedances.
4️⃣ Quick Date Filters (Bottom of the Report)
The report includes additional filters for fast navigation between different time periods:

TD (Today) – Displays data for the current day.
CW (Current Week) – Shows data for the current week.
LW (Last Week) – Displays last week's data.
2W, CM, LM, 3M – Allows analyzing data for 2 weeks, current month, last month, or the last 3 months.
📌 Summary
This report monitors the efficiency of changeovers on the production line, helping identify areas for improvement. It highlights where actual changeover times exceed targets, enabling data-driven decisions for process optimization.
